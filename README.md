## Introduction
The primary goal of [BookWorm](https://github.com/book-worm-2010/book-worm-fe) is to have the user be able track their reading progress with features that let the user add "bookmarks", comments, and ratings of each book during the user's reading journey.

#### Motivation
The motivation behind this project's creation was to build an application to help the users track their reading progress through a digital log, focused on using React/ React Hooks as a framework, writing DRY JavaScript, SASS, and accessing data with RESTful APIs and solidifying good habits in git workflow.
